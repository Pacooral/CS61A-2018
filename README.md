## One thing must be mentioned: the project ants is 2020-fall and its website is [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/proj/ants/) .
I spent nearly three months on finishing all homeworks,labs,discussion and projects.This lesson is quite interesting and will be a fantastic journey for a fresher to learn the OOP and other significant ways of thinking. I hope you can find your own answer in this course. Just try it!
